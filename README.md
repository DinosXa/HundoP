# HundoP

This is my first private repository for the assignment requirements of the Software Eningineering in Practice (SEiP) course offered by the Department of Management Science & Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

# Assignment

my assignment is to create a Java application (by using the Maven build automation tool) that reads a file with studentsâ€™
grades and generates its histogram.

# Project Structure

This repository consists of a parent Maven project and a child (module) Maven project, that handle the dependencies in a different way.

# HundoP

This is my first private repository for the assignment requirements of the Software Eningineering in Practice (SEiP) course offered by the Department of Management Science & Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business.

# Assignment

my assignment is to create a Java application (by using the Maven build automation tool) that reads a file with students’
grades and generates its histogram.

# Project Structure

This repository consists of a parent Maven project and a child (module) Maven project, that handle the dependencies in a different way.

# Prerequisites

In order to be able to run this on your local computer, firstly you will need to download the following:

:Eclipse
:Apache Maven
:Git bash (for windows)
:Terminal (already installed in Mac)

# Configuration

fork this directory and clone it in your local computer using the command:

```
git clone
```

Then open Git-Bash or Terminal depending on if you have mac or windows and execute the following command in the repository root directory in order to build all modules:

```
mvn package
```

This command generates a seperate jar file in each module's corresponding target (module/target) directory.

Next step is typing in the command:

 ```
mvn clean install
```

### gradeshistogram
This module has no dependencies and thus it requires only the definition of the class that is the main entry point of the system (the class that contains the main method). 
```
<plugin>
				<artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin</artifactId>
				<configuration>
					<archive>
						<manifest>
						  <classpathPrefix>lib/</classpathPrefix>
							<addClasspath>true</addClasspath>
						<!-- replace this with the class that contains the main method. It requires also the package name if exists. -->
							<mainClass>gradeshistogram.HistogramGenerator</mainClass> 
						</manifest>
					</archive>
					<descriptorRefs>
						<descriptorRef>jar-with-dependencies</descriptorRef>
					</descriptorRefs>
				</configuration>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>make-assembly</id>
						<phase>package</phase>
						<goals>
							<goal>single</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
```

The produced jar is located in the target directory and can be executed as following:
```
java -jar gradeshistogram/target/HistogramGenerator0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar



Apache Maven is a popular build tool, that takes your project’s Java source code, compiles it, tests it and converts it into an executable Java program: either a .jar or a .war file. mvn clean install command does exactly that. You are using the clean command, which will delete all previously compiled Java sources and resources (like .properties) in your project. Your build will start from a clean slate.Install will then compile, test & package your Java project and even install/copy your built .jar/.war file into your local Maven repository.
